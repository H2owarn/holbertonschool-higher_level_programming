# Python - if/else, loops, and functions

This project focuses on understanding and implementing conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python. It is part of the Holberton School curriculum for higher-level programming.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose of `if`, `if ... else`, and `elif` statements.
- Use loops (`for` and `while`) effectively.
- Write and call functions in Python.
- Understand variable scope and function arguments.
- Use the `return` statement to return values from functions.

## Project Structure

- **0-positive_or_negative.py**: Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1-last_digit.py**: Prints the last digit of a random number.
- **2-print_alphabet.py**: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- **3-print_alphabt.py**: Prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.


## Requirements

- Python3
- Code must follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.git 

## Usage

To run a script, use:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the file you want to execute.
